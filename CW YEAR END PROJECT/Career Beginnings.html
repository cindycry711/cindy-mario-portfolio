	<div class="b" align="center"><font color="white">Between the ages of 15 and 17, Trainor 
	independently released three albums of material she
	had written, recorded, and performed. Her eponymous
	debut album, Meghan Trainor, was released on 
	December 25, 2009, receiving airplay from local 
	Massachusetts radio station WCIB. Trainor enrolled 
	in the Summer Performance Program at the Berklee 
	College of Music during the summers of 2009 and 2010
	, reaching the finals of the program's songwriting 
	competition She released "Take Care of Our Soldiers"
	on April 16, 2010, a charity song in support of 
	American troops abroad. The following year, Trainor
	released two acoustic albums, I'll Sing with You and
	Only 17. </p><br><br>

	At a music conference in Colorado, Trainor was 
	introduced to former NRBQ member, Al Anderson. 
	He was impressed by Trainor's songwriting and 
	referred her to his publisher, Carla Wallace at 
	Nashville-based Big Yellow Dog Music. Though Trainor
	had been offered a full scholarship to the Berklee 
	College of Music, she decided to pursue her 
	songwriting career and signed with Big Yellow Dog. 
	She began her career as a songwriter-for-hire 
	because of her ability to tackle a variety of 
	genres She began by publishing songs for others and 
	was unsure about becoming a recording artist. Her 
	father said, "She thought she was one of the chubby
	girls who would never be an artist". Trainor 
	graduated from Nauset Regional High School in 2012.
	Her second promotional single, "Who I Wanna Be", was
	released on April 24, 2012. </p><br><br>

	Throughout 2013, Trainor traveled to Nashville, New 
	York City and Los Angeles, where she wrote and 
	helped produce country and pop music. She sang lead
	and background vocals on demos for other artists, 
	with her vocals occasionally being used on the final
	recording. She earned her first songwriting 
	royalties by writing for Italian artists. In June 
	2013, Trainor met producer Kevin Kadish in 
	Nashville via Wallace and a mutual friend. Kadish 
	and Trainor both liked retro style music and began 
	recording together that month. Trainor later became 
	frustrated with commuting from Nantucket to Los 
	Angeles for songwriting sessions. Her parents did 
	not want her to relocate as it would be expensive. 
	In November, Trainor decided to relocate to 
	Nashville instead. There, she wrote songs for a 
	number of acts, including Hunter Hayes, Rascal 
	Flatts, R5, and Sabrina Carpenter. </p>
