		<p class="typewriter-text">Microbit, also known as Microsoft MakeCode: Microbit, is a pocket-sized, programmable
				physical device originally developed by the BBC to promote digital education. 
				Microsoft offers a wide range of MakeCode programming environments, but in high school
				, the course we were offered focused specifically on Microbit instead of other 
				platforms like Arcade or Minecraft. This made Microbit one of my earliest 
				introductions to hardware and coding.

				It features built-in components like an LED matrix, buttons, sensors, and a buzzer â€” 
				all of which we learned to control using block-based programming similar to Scratch. 
				The platform also supports text-based languages like JavaScript and Python, allowing 
				students to gradually transition into more advanced coding as they progress. Through 
				hands-on projects, I learned how to make interactive systems that combine both 
				software logic and physical hardware â€” something that sparked my long-lasting interest
				in computing and design.

		  Due to the inactivity of the account, my microbit account has been deleted, however I 
		  was still able to retrieve some microbit .hex files from my high school laptop, thus I 
		  have created a new account and uploaded the files to create a new repository. These 
		  are the links that will lead to that original project i was working on in high school. 
		  Enjoy the showcase!

					<h2>Score Keeper</h2>
					<p class="typewriter-text">Oh? Got addicted with competing against microbit? Worry you not! Here's a score keeper to track
		you and Microbit's scores! P stands for "Player" (that's you!) and M stands for "Microbit" 
		(your mortal enemy). Press the "A" Button (left) will increase 1 point to Player's Score! Press 
		the "B" Button (right) when Microbit wins, to give it one point. Want to check the score?
		Shake the microbit by moving your mouse around fast! Or just click on the "Shake" button.
		Microbit will either print the string "Player Win" (if you win), "Microbit Win" (if Microbit wins)
		or "Tie" (if you both tie!) May the best player win, don't get cold feet!</p>
